# Register no:212222060020

# Aim: 
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

## AI Tools Required: 

* ChatGPT (or any Large Language Model)
* Computer / Mobile Interface for interaction

# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

## **Prompt Used:**

**"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries.
The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."**

---

## **Procedure:**

1. **Define Requirements**

   * The assistant should:

     * Accept and organize daily tasks
     * Schedule events and reminders
     * Suggest wellness tips
     * Answer general queries
     * Adapt to user preferences

2. **Construct Prompts**

   * Develop task-specific prompts such as:

     * “Add a task to remind me at 6 PM to call mom.”
     * “Suggest a wellness tip for today.”
     * “Schedule a study session for tomorrow from 4–6 PM.”
     * “List my pending tasks.”

3. **Simulate User Interaction**

   * Interact with ChatGPT through a command-line or chat interface.
   * Test multiple user inputs and observe how the responses change.

4. **Collect Feedback & Adapt Prompts**

   * Modify prompts based on desired behavior.
   * Enhance prompt clarity, constraints, and context.

5. **(Optional) Implement Memory Simulation**

   * Add a section in prompts like:

     * “Remember that I prefer morning reminders.”
   * Use repeated instructions to simulate adaptive behavior.
